# Iot-PythonDashboard
Academic Project for IoT Course.

# Project Description
By utilizing sensors, actuators, motors, Single-board computers, and micro-controllers, students
design and simulate a smart home. They capture environmental information and make a decision
based on received data. They also develop access control and occupancy systems and transfer all
data to the cloud or a local server. Finally, they design and develop a web-based IoT dashboard to
control and monitor the system.
