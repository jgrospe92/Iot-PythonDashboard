# Iot-PythonDashboard
Academic Project for IoT Course.

# Project Description
By utilizing sensors, actuators, motors, Single-board computers, and micro-controllers, students
design and simulate a smart home. They capture environmental information and make a decision
based on received data. They also develop access control and occupancy systems and transfer all
data to the cloud or a local server. Finally, they design and develop a web-based IoT dashboard to
control and monitor the system. 

# Virtual Environment
## Windows
- cd to the to main directory
- Once inside Iot-PythonDashboard
- Run the command `Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
- Your terminal should change into this (Iot-PythonDashboard)
- To deactivate it, run the command `deactivate`

## Arduino & MAc
- cd to the to main directory
- Once inside Iot-PythonDashboard
- Run the command `source Scripts/activate` to activate the virtual environment
- Your terminal should change into this (Iot-PythonDashboard)
- To deactivate it, run the command `deactivate`
- 
# Important
- Make sure you name the folder Iot-PythonDashboard

# Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you're in the python environment
- Then run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If the above command doesnt work
- You have to install each dependencies manually by running this command
- `pip install {the name of the dependency}`
- Check the requirements.txt for the names
